I'm a cat who can write **programs**.

Yes, I'm *kidding* :)

I am writing a program using a <ins>2013 iMac</ins>.

macOS uses <ins>OpenCore Legacy Patcher</ins> and is running <ins>Sonoma</ins>.

<ins>Minecraft</ins> is fun :D

I have submitted pull requests to LiquidBounce and they all **failed**!

My code skills are **not** good at *all*!
